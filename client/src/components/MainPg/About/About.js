      <p>In this day and age of influencers and food bloggers who post food images and rate them. Its natural that anyone would want to taste it atleast once but the problem occurs when we don't know the recipe to the food. That's where this site comes handy, just hand the image to the website and it shall display the recipe to the food.</p>
